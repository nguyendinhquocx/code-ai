# Blog Writing Guidelines

Write blog posts that are genuine, helpful, easy to read - readers must NOT detect AI wrote it.

## Voice & Tone

### NEVER Use These (AI Markers)

**Buzzwords - Avoid Completely:**
- "seamlessly", "powerful", "robust", "leverage"
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"
- "unlock", "empower", "transform", "elevate"
- "harness", "streamline", "optimize" (unless literal meaning)
- "dive deep", "let's explore", "in today's world"
- "at the end of the day", "it's worth noting"
- Emoji, icons, decorative symbols
- Too many exclamation marks!!!

**AI Patterns - Avoid:**
- Generic openings: "In the world of...", "Have you ever wondered..."
- Empty conclusions: "In conclusion...", "To sum up..."
- Excessive transitions: "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally"
- Passive voice: "It can be seen that...", "It is important to note..."
- Over-the-top superlatives: "the best", "the most amazing"

### ALWAYS Use These

**Personal Voice:**
- "I use", "I found", "I tried", "I built"
- "I got tired of...", "I needed...", "I wanted..."
- "This helped me...", "I use this when..."
- Real stories, real experiences

**Straightforward Language:**
- Short, clear sentences
- Simple, understandable words
- Active voice: "I wrote this" not "This was written"
- Specific numbers: "5 seconds" not "very fast"
- Honest language: "This isn't perfect", "It has limitations"

**Real Examples:**
- Specific scenarios from real life
- Real numbers: "10 minutes wasted", "5 seconds total"
- Real problems: "I spent two hours configuring..."
- Real results: no exaggeration

## Post Structure

### 1. Opening Hook

**BAD:**
```
In today's fast-paced digital world, productivity tools are essential.
```

**GOOD:**
```
I use four different AI agents for coding. Every morning I'd open terminals,
type commands, navigate folders. Ten minutes wasted before writing code.
```

Formula:
- Start with SPECIFIC pain point
- Personal story, not generic
- Real numbers: time, count, etc.
- Brief: 2-3 sentences max

### 2. Problem Section

Describe problem in detail:
- Why default solution isn't enough
- Specific pain points, not vague
- Compare with existing solutions
- Bullet points for easy scanning

### 3. Solution Introduction

Keep it simple:
- Brief, no hype
- Say directly what it does
- Why different from alternatives

**BAD:**
```
This revolutionary tool seamlessly transforms your workflow.
```

**GOOD:**
```
WezTerm is a terminal emulator written in Rust.
Cross-platform, fast, fully scriptable with Lua.
```

### 4. Features Breakdown

Each feature gets its own section:
- Clear heading
- Explain what feature does
- Why feature is useful
- Specific example or code snippet
- Connect to real use case

### 5. Real Workflow Examples

**BAD:**
```
You can use this for various tasks throughout your day.
```

**GOOD:**
```
**Morning routine:**
1. Open WezTerm (auto-maximizes)
2. Ctrl+Shift+P
3. Hit Enter
4. Claude and Opencode load in separate tabs

Total time: 5 seconds.
```

### 6. Comparison with Alternatives

Honest comparison - both pros and cons:

```
## Why [Tool] over alternatives

**[Alternative 1]:**
- Pro: [honest advantage]
- Con: [real limitation]

I tried X. Spent Y hours...
```

Rules:
- No trash talk
- Recognize alternative pros
- Explain why your solution fits YOUR use case
- Personal experience with alternatives

### 7. Who Should Use This

```
This makes sense if you:
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

It doesn't make sense if you:
- [Scenario 1]
- [Limitation that matters]
```

### 8. Bottom Line

**BAD:**
```
In conclusion, this tool will revolutionize your workflow
and unlock unprecedented productivity gains.
```

**GOOD:**
```
I used to waste 10 minutes every morning setting up terminals.
Now it's one keyboard shortcut.

If you work with multiple CLI tools and hate repetitive setup,
try this config. See if it saves you time.
```

Elements:
- Restate core benefit with real numbers
- Honest about what it is and isn't
- Simple CTA: "try it", no pressure
- Personal voice until the end

## Formatting Rules

**Paragraphs:**
- Short: 2-4 sentences max
- One idea per paragraph
- Space between paragraphs

**Lists:**
- Bullets for options/features
- Numbers for steps
- Bold for emphasis, not italic

**Headings:**
- Clear, descriptive
- No clickbait
- H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections

## Pre-Publish Checklist

**Voice & Tone:**

- [ ] Honest about pros AND cons
- [ ] No hype, no superlatives
- [ ] Reads like human wrote it

**Content:**
- [ ] Strong opening hook (specific pain point)
- [ ] Problem clearly defined
- [ ] Solution explained simply
- [ ] Real examples, not generic
- [ ] Honest comparison with alternatives
- [ ] Clear setup guide (if applicable)
- [ ] Honest "who should use" section

**Technical:**
- [ ] Code tested and works

## Golden Rules

1. **Write like talking to a friend** - not a presentation, not sales pitch

2. **Absolute honesty** - state limitations, don't oversell

3. **Specific > Generic** - "10 minutes wasted" not "saves time"

4. **Show, don't tell** - examples over descriptions

5. **Personal experience** - "I use", "I found", not "users can"

6. **No pressure** - "try it if you want", not "you must have this"

7. **Respect reader intelligence** - don't explain obvious, don't condescend

8. **Useful > Impressive** - focus on helping, not showing off

## Final Test

Read the post out loud. If it sounds like marketing copy, sales pitch, or formal documentation -> rewrite. Good posts sound like chatting with a dev friend over coffee.
